# Galleria
Galleria is an extension of the modern online shopping system. It enhances the user experience of viewing and interacting with products. Using modern Augmented technology the user can view the product in 3D, can also interact with the product, and can see if the product really meets his/her requirements. Our system can be integrated very easily into any modern shopping website which can further enhance user experience.
